I want to create a 1 pager website called EatATL, this website will be stunning, modern, catchy and intuitive and its main purpose is to display lists of different atlanta restaurants according to their cuisine. 
The cuisine will be listed as bubbles at the top followed by the restaurants. 
I would also like to capture their google rating if an API is available and display how they are rated. 
I do not have software engineering skills so this has to be as simple as possible and understandable for me.
